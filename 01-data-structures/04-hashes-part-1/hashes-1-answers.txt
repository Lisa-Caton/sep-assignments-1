We learned in the previous checkpoint one of the consequences of using 
any Array is the potential it has to asks for more memory than the operating 
system allows.  Our routine is recursively doubling the size of Array we didn't 
delete which makes this a very poor choice for a production environment.

Hash Values:
... ["Empire Strikes Back"] = "Excellent" - Hash: 44
 ["A New Hope"] = "Average" - Hash: 43
 ["Return of the Jedi"] = "The Best" - Hash: 30
.. ["key"] = "value" - Hash: 1
. ["The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"] = "3 hours, 48 minutes" - Hash: 5
 ["The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"] = "3 hours, 55 minutes" - Hash: 4
 ["The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"] = "3 hours, 48 minutes" - Hash: 17
 ["The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"] = "3 hours, 55 minutes" - Hash: 4
