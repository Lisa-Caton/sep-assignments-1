Describe an analogy for relating an algorithm that has efficiency O(1) and 
another algorithm that has O(2n). 

  An algorithm that has O(1) is a rocket ship and an algorithm 
  that has O(2n) is a locomotive.

In plain English, what is the best case scenario for binary search?

  When the target value is in the middle of the collection and returned 
  in the first iteration.

In plain English, what is the worst-case scenario for binary search?

  When the target value is located at the final iteration.

In plain English, what is the bounded-case scenario for binary search?

  When the target value is located at some point between the first and
  final iteration for any given collection.

What is the limit of the function above as n approaches infinity?

  The limit appears to be positive infinity as n approaches infinity

What is the Big-O of an algorithm that has the data points above?

  O(2^n)

Write a Ruby method that takes a number n. This method must print the 
worst-case number of iterations for linear search to find an item in 
collections of size one to n. Use it to generate a table of worst-case 
iterations of collections up to size 10.

  def linear_function(n)
    for i in 1..n
      puts "#{i}, #{i}"
    end
  end

Create a graph from the output using Google Sheets or other graphing 
software. Analyze the graph and denote its Big-O somewhere on the graph.
